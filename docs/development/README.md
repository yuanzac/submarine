# 1. Introduction

This document mainly describes the structure of each module of the submarine project, the development and test description of each module.

# 2. Submarine Project Structure

### 2.1 dev-support

+ **mini-submarine** : by using the docker image provided by submarine, you can experience all the functions of submarine in a single docker environment, while mini-submarine also provides developers with a development and testing environment, Avoid the hassle of installing and deploying the runtime environment.
+ **submarine-installer**: Submarine-installer is our submarine runtime environment installation tool for yarn-3.1+ and above.By using submarine-installer, it is easy to install and deploy system services such as `docker`, `nvidia-docker`, `nvidia driver`, `ETCD`, `Calico network` etc. required by yarn-3.1+.

### 2.2 submarine-all

Waiting for supplement

### 2.3 submarine-core

Waiting for supplement

### 2.4 submarine-dist

Waiting for supplement

### 2.5 submarine-dist

Waiting for supplement

### 2.6 submarine-runtime

Waiting for supplement

### 2.7 submarine-dist

Waiting for supplement

### 2.8 submarine-server

+ **submarine-server**: is a Jetty-based web server service. Submarine-server provides RESTful interface and Websocket interface. The RESTful interface provides submarine-web with management capabilities for databases such as project, department, user, and role.

### 2.9 submarine-tony

Waiting for supplement

### 2.10 submarine-web

+ **submarine-web** : is a web front-end service based on `VUE.js` framework. With `submarine-web` users can manage submarine project, department, user, role through browser. You can also use the notebook to develop machine learning algorithms, model release and other lifecycle management.

### 2.11 submarine-sdk

+ **pysubmarine**: By using submarine's python sdk library, you can output metrics such as metrics when the algorithm is executed in your python program by importing pysubmarine during the development of the machine learning algorithm.

# 3. Submarine Workbench Development Guide

Submarine workbench consists of three modules: submarine-server, submarine-web and database. 

First, you need to clone the entire submarine project: 

```
git clone https://github.com/hadoopsubmarine/submarine.git
```

## 3.1 Database

Submarine selects mysql as the workbench database, and stores the table structure and information of all the data in workbench in mysql. Please browse the project's [Submarine Database Guide](../database/) documentation and follow the instructions to install a mysql database via docker in your development and test environment.

## 3.2 Submarine-web

+ **Install dependencies**

You only need to execute the following command when you run submarine-web for the first time, so you can follow the depend. environment of node.js in the submarine-web directory.

```bash
cd submarine/submarine-web
yarn install
```

The node.js dependency library will be installed in the node_modules directory. node_modules does not need to be uploaded to the git repository. We have excluded it in the submarine/.gitignore file. You can clean this by manually deleting the directory or executing mvn clean. table of Contents.

+ **Compiles and hot-reloads for development**

```bash
yarn run build
```

By executing the above command, `submarine-web` will publish the web page to the `submarine-web/dist` directory. Later we will also add the feature of `submarine-web` to a WAR package, which only requires a `submarine-web.war` file. Package can release submarine workbench.

+ **Lints and fixes files**

When you write the `vue, js` file in `submarine-web` through IDEA, because IDEA can't format these files well, you need to execute the following command to format the vue and js files to avoid some warnings during the yarn build. 

```
yarn run lint
```

In fact, you must execute this command when you develop and submit any submarine-web feture. Otherwise, chances are that you won't be able to check the code specification we set up in Travis.

## 3.3 Submarine-server

Submarine-server has a built-in jetty server service, so you don't need to install any web container service. You can start submarine workbench by launching `submarine-server` directly in IDEA.

+ **Run / Debug** : In the IDEA, add a Run/Debug Configuration, `Main Class:` select `org.apache.submarine.server.SubmarineServer`, `Use classpath of module:` select `submarine-server`. 

![img](../assets/Run-Debug-Configuration.png)

So you can pass http://127.0.0.1:8080 debugging or running to submarine-workbench.

+ **It should be noted**: 

1. Because `submarine-web/dist` is the webapp default directory of the submarine-server Jetty Server, the submarine-server will automatically load the `submarine-web/dist` directory after startup.

2. The `submarine-web/dist` used by `submarine-server` is used as the webapp directory, which is configured via `Submarine-site.xml`, but we do not recommend you to modify it.

3. The submarine-workbench, IP and 8080 ports that are accessible locally through the port 8080 of 127.0.0.1 are configured via  `Submarine-site.xml`, but we do not recommend you to modify it.

4. When you modify the `vue` or `js` of submarine-web, you need to execute the yarn run build command in the submarine-web directory, and let your modified code update to the dist directory, so that you can see the effect of your code modification in the workbench.
