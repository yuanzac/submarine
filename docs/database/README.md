# Submarine Database

Submarine needs to use the database to store information about the `organization`, `user`, `projects`, `tasks` and configuration of the system information, So consider using mysql to store this data.

+ MySQL will be included in the `mini-submarine` docker image to allow users to quickly experience the `submarine workbench`.
+ In a production environment, the `submarine workbench` can be connected to the official mysql database.

## Prerequisite

Must:

- MySQL
- MyBatis

## Run mysql on docker

Run the mysql container, modify the character set (if you need to support Chinese), Create a submarine database.

```bash
~bash> docker run -p 3306:3306 -d --name mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password mysql:5.7.27
~bash> docker exec -it mysql bash
```

## Modify character set (Optional)

If you need to store Chinese character data in mysql, you need to execute the following command to modify the mysql character set.

+ Set database character set

  ```
  bash > mysql -uroot -ppassword
  
  mysql>SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'character_set_%'; // View database character set
  mysql>SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'collation_%';
  
  SET NAMES 'utf8';
  ```

+ Configuration `mysqld.cnf`

  ```
  # install vim
  apt-get update
  apt-get install vim
  
  vi /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
  
  [mysqld]
  character_set_server = utf8
  
  [mysql]
  default-character-set = utf8
  
  [mysql.server]
  default-character-set = utf8
  
  [mysqld_safe]
  default-character-set = utf8
  
  [client]
  default-character-set = utf8
  ```

## Create Submarine Database

### Create development database

Development database for development environment.

```
# in mysql container
bash > mysql -uroot -ppassword
mysql> CREATE USER 'submarine'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'submarine'@'%';
mysql> CREATE DATABASE submarineDB CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
mysql> use submarineDB;
mysql> source ./docs/database/submarine.sql;
mysql> quit
```

>  NOTE: submarine development database name is  `submarineDB` and user name is `submarine`, password is `password`, This is the default value in the system's `submarine-site.xml` configuration file and is not recommended for modification.


### Create test database

Test database for program unit testing and Travis test environment.

```
# in mysql container
bash > mysql -uroot -ppassword
mysql> CREATE USER 'submarine_test'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password_test';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'submarine_test'@'%';
mysql> CREATE DATABASE `submarineDB_test` CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
mysql> use `submarineDB_test`;
mysql> source ./docs/database/submarine.sql;
mysql> quit
```

>  NOTE: submarine test database name is  `submarineDB_test` and user name is `submarine_test`, password is `password_test`, Cannot be configured, values that cannot be modified.


## Travis

1. In the submarine's Travis, the `test database`, `database name`, `username` and `password` will be automatically created based on the contents of this document. 

   Therefore, do not modify the database's `database name`, `username` and `password` configuration to avoid introducing some problems.

2. In the mysql database in Travis, the `submarine.sql` and `submarine_test.sql` files are executed to create the submarine database table structure and test data.

3. The submarine database test case written in the `submarine-server` module will also be unit tested in the mysql database in travis.
